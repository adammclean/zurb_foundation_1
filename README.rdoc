Springfield Orchestra
---------------------

*An activity to learn Zurb Foundation*

The Springfield Philharmic Orchestra is building a new site on Rails, and needs
your help in styling it! Install Zurb Foundation and implement some of its
features.

##Getting Started

This is a Rails 4.1.2 application. Copy the `springfield-orch` folder to a
directory outside of the class github, then `cd` into it and run `bundle
install`, `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, and `rake db:seed`.
